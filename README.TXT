In this game, which has not been given a name due to lack of creativity,
the goal is to estimate values which will result in the projectile hitting
the target.

For menu navigation, type in the word or value which is asked. If a word is asked,
it is not case sensitive. Also, you may simply type in the first letter of the word
to make a selection. In the settings, rows and columns correspond to the dimensions
of the game board. The wait time is recorded in milliseconds and corresponds to how
much delay there is between each frame of the projectile animation.

The board is surrounded by asterisks (*) which act as the border. To the
left, there will be your start point (O). The starting point is generated
within the middle 50% vertical values, but always on the left-most side.
Somewhere else on the board you will see the goal (X). The goal's position
will be randomly generated each time. However, that is not the only thing
that will be generated each time.

Below your board, you will see some data, such as your total score and average
score per round. Below that line of text, you will see either "Direction" or
"Speed", followed by a value. You are to enter in the missing value, i.e. if
you are given a direction, you are to enter a speed. Speed is measured in
arbitrary units, while direction is measured in degrees such that straight up is
90 degrees while straight down is -90 degrees.

There is no code ensuring that every goal is obtainable with the given values, but
if you ever find yourself with a direction facing away from the goal, try entering
a negative value to defy gravity!

Everything else that you need to know should be explained within the game. You may
start off with some poor scores, but once you figure out how the arbitrary units
of speed work, you'll (probably) be able to reach higher scores!
